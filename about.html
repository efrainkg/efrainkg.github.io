                        <p>Hello my name is Efrain Gonzalez. I figured I would use this section to actually talk a bit about myself. I'm 34 years old and this has been my first foray into coding. If I'm being completely honest, it has been, and continues to be very challenging. But challenging in a good way. I feel mentally stimulated (followed by mentally exhausted lol) and I really enjoy the feeling of accomplishment when, after a lot of trial and error, I'm able to place a div on my page exactly where I want it. It's the small milestones that help keep me going. One thing I've noticed is that the opportunities for learning start to become fewer and far between as you get older. And if you're like me and haven't been in a classroom setting in a while, it's easy to forget that the uncomfortable or uncertain feeling is a normal part of the process. I remind myself of it daily and it helps when I need to put my anxious feelings aside and ask for help. With time and practice, I know that this will all become more intuitive.
                            <br><br>
                        Now that I've spilled my guts about anxiety and the challenges of learning something new, I feel like I should mention the excitement because these past 6 weeks have been full of it. In recent years, I've felt stagnant as far as my work or career trajectory. I've been patching drywall, hanging doors, and unclogging toilets for the past 3 years. And for years before that I was usually breaking my back doing some form of skilled or semi-skilled labor. I really enjoy working with my hands and the pay wasn't horrible, but I had little to no creative input in my work. It was show up, clock in, and give your body to the job. I felt chewed up and spat out. But this websites for beginners class has opened my eyes. Despite the challenges I mentioned before, I am very excited and ambitious about what these new skills could mean for my ability to break into a new industry. More specifically, an industry where I can also apply myself creatively.
